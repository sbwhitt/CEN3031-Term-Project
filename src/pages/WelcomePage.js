            The Study Abroad Peer Advisor (SAPA) organization is a group of students who have previously studied 
            abroad and are now dedicated to sharing their experiences with other students. We assist students 
            interested in learning more about UFâ€™s study abroad opportunities by matching them with students who 
            have studied on similar programs/locations, or who share similar academic interests. Come to the 
            International Center and talk to us or reach out any time.
          </p>
          <p className="welcome-text">
            We would love to talk with you! The office hours posted are when our SAPAs can be seen in person in 
            the Study Abroad Services lobby in the International Center.
