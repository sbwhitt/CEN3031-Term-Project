It is an incredible growing experience since you are transplanted, alone, to a foreign country.  Although England was similar in a lot of ways to the US, there were still so many differences that I had to get used to.  My parents and any extended family were thousands of miles away.

            "I chose to study abroad in China because I was recently inspired by a Chinese student who was at my practicum site last fall. He came to an American school for the first this year, not knowing any English, and grew so much by December. I was interested in dual process thinking, and how China\u2019s advanced education system teaches English to their students. While conducting my High Honors research project, I wanted to discover successful strategies for teaching English to diverse learners. I was able to discover successful teaching strategies from instructors and some really cool fifth graders. Similarly, I wanted to know how to effectively communicate with people who are not from my native country so I studied Intercultural Communications at Southwest Minzu University. I found out that this university was once named Southwest University for Nationalities and was one of the first institutions to in Chengdu to hold over 50 ethnicities in their student population. I also wanted to embrace the culture of Chengdu and China, so I studied Tai-Chi, Sichuan Cuisine, and was also placed in an Introductions to Chinese I course at the same university. It sounds like a lot, but it was only 6 credits for the Session 1 of the Summer!",
            "Puerto Rico and Haiti. ",
            "I had a very tough transition to the country in which I studied abroad. Being Black in China meant that some people reacted to me like they saw a ghost, or a savage. I had children gasp and halt at the sight of me. I had people point and stare at me, gossiping to the next person next to me as I glanced in their direction. People took countless pictures of me as well...which made me ask myself if I did something wrong? I was self-conscious because I questioned if I offended them. I attracted a lot more attention than what I was used to in America. Comparing these new surroundings to my comfort back home made me incredibly homesick and anti-social for the first couple of days. I stayed in my apartment and cried many times to my boyfriend over Facetime. Then suddenly, I told myself that this is not what I wanted to remember China to be like for me. I gave myself a week of feeling my valid emotions as I transitioned to a completely different country. I journaled about the new places I challenged myself to go, such as the local grocery store and a 30 minute morning walk outside of the campus gates. This was the first time I opened up to China to see if it would be hospitable enough to make it my home this summer...and it did. On my eighth day, I embraced the Beyonce` treatment and took up everything China had to offer me!\n",
            "My advice would to be consider third-party study abroad programs. They can be much cheaper and inclusive of costs that are usually an outside charge. Other than that, be sure you are making financial comparisons and then apply for as many study abroad scholarships as possible!",
            "I went to LGBTQ+ club in Chengdu and it changed my life! As my study abroad trip progressed, I learned that my peer group had a range of sexualities. I identity as a heterosexual, but I\u2019m set on learning how to be a better ally for the LBTQ+ community. I feel as though the best way to do this is to be active in their culture and, ultimately, their world. Fast forward to a random hangout at a teahouse in JinLi Street, my friend brought up a website that allows you to search for LGBTQ+ clubs anywhere in the world [Wow moment]. A couple of days later in our WeChat group, there was a follow up with a popular club in Chengdu: MAX. As we were strolling through town, it seemed to me that the club was underground. You two metro lines...some walking... take two elevators and walk through some alleys until you approach a poster of a shirtless man. Then you make a quick left and wah-lah, a strip of LBTQ+ clubs on one walkway. MAX was an incredible experience with my friends. The DJ was super welcoming and made sure we felt the hospitality. He spoke English and played tons of pop English songs for us to dance to. There were bright lights, fruit platters, sparklers, a karaoke stage, neon words hanging on the wall. I really enjoyed myself that Thursday night. I invited everyone in the club to the bouncy dance floor and made some new Chinese friends. It felt really liberating...I wasn\u2019t worried about \u201csaving face\u201d or my unshaved armpits. I jumped up and down with my arms and mind swinging freely. Afterwards, we headed to a Lesbian club next door and that was fun as well. I\u2019ve noticed that people in China love Americans when it comes to the night scene. We ended up getting a VIP treatment anywhere we went. After a couple of hours, my friends and I walked to a 24 hour McDonalds and grabbed a taxi home~we were back by 3am. This night was for the books, definitely one of my top two moments while I was Chengdu. I encourage you to find the LGBTQ+ community in your new town. It\u2019ll open your eyes. "

But on my study abroad trip in Kaikoura, we were able to swim with dusky dolphins in their natural habitat. We went on a thirty minute boat ride until we found a wild pod, and we joined them in the ocean. We were advised to swim around excitedly and let the dolphins curiosity take over. Sure enough, in a few moments they were swimming around us, clicking at us, and challenging us to race them. It was the most amazing time of my life."

In each city I spent my time exploring the cities, seeing the sites, eating local cuisine, and experiencing the culture. While I was in Hungary they made it to the round of 16 in the Euro cup, farther than they had in years. The whole city was partying and I was lucky to be a part of that.",

It was something I had never experienced before and brought me much confusion. ",

Studying abroad was a life changing decision that still impacts me years after I went. ",

Without realizing it, the boat ride was 3 hours one way. But this accident would give us some of the most beautiful sights of the entire trip. Seeing the Italian Alps from the top of the ship was mesmerizing. We had accidentally had the best experience of the whole trip."

            "During my study abroad, I was examining race relations in Brazil, specifically the systematic discrimination and racism that Afro-Brazilians nowadays face. The program, UF in Bahia, allowed me to see how Afro-Bahian culture has controversially become a means of survival for many people since tourism depends heavily on it. With my service-learning internship, I was exposed to black-owned organizations and black activists that are not only helping their communities with viable resources but are also promoting the black consciousness movement in Brazil.

He hugged me like 6 times and kept thanking me for coming to Brazil. His exact words were \"Thank you for traveling all the way here. I don't often meet foreigners that look like me and that I can bond with because of our common background. Despite the discrimination here and other places, it's important for us diaspora to stay connected no matter what.\" That night, I knew that I made an impact in his life and so did he!
